            <p>For the last few years I have always wanted a tiny house after seeing them on the hgtv. 
                <p></p>
                <p>A tiny house for me represents going off grid and sustainability. It also represents a way to end homelessness.

        <p> Besides being extremely cute tiny houses can be extremely energy efficient too. They are cheaper to build than average sized homes and can be mobile.</p>
